In matter of minutes zillow scraper can scrape real estate data from zillow
It can scrape data like property address, price, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.(Detail information is in the description below)
It can scrape properties that are for rent, for sale, and recently sold properties.
It can scrape the zillow map by the URL.
It can scrape data from multiple pages and save the data in a CSV file.
All you have to provide is the URL of the zillow page you want to scrape and the scraper will do the rest.

From the property, the scraper can scrape the following data:
Zpid of Listing, Home Status(for sale, for rent, sold), Thumbnail of Listing, URL of Listing, Listing Price, Zestimate, RentZestimate, 
Address (Street, City, State, Zipcode), Number of Beds, Number of Baths, Sqft Area, Days on Zillow, Broker Name, Photos of House.

If you need further detailed data, I can also scrape that for you by scraping one more layer in the property page.
